# 09 Node.js Homework: Professional README Generator

When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app.

## Installation Instructions

Your task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). Review the [Professional README Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide) as a reminder of everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain.

## Usage

Create a `.gitignore` file and include `node_modules/` and `.DS_Store/` so that your `node_modules` directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your `.gitignore` file before installing any npm dependencies.

## Contributing

Make sure that your repo includes a `package.json` with the required dependencies. You can create one by running `npm init` when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies.

## Tests

Include a video of the typical user flow through your application. This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection.
